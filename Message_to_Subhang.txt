Just saying, nice idea!




When working, please go to the Built-In Functions.







You can either read this document or complete Episode 11

Also, the syntax is different than your planned syntax

So when you are going to make Tokens or change them, you could always look at the tutorial (CodePulse's) and watch how he does it and try to do it simmilarly.



How to make BuiltInFunction Step 1:



    #So make a function(example)

def example_function(self, exec_ctx):
  # And make some changes here
  valueA_ = exec_ctx.symbol_table.get('valueA')
  valueB_ = exec_ctx.symbol_table.get('valueB')


  # Example Processing

  if not isinstance(valueA_, Number):
            return RTResult().failure(RTError(
            self.pos_start, self.pos_end,
            "First argument must be number",
            exec_ctx
        ))

  if not isinstance(valueB_, Number):
            return RTResult().failure(RTError(
            self.pos_start, self.pos_end,
            "Second argument must be number",
            exec_ctx
        ))

  #Return anything you'd like

  return RTResult().success(Number.null)

#Get Variables from symbol table

execute_example_function.arg_names = ["valueA", valueB]


STEP 2:

  Try Command-F to and type in some example function(e.g. print) and you will see how it was created. experiment!
